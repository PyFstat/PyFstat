# PyFstat

This is a python package providing an interface to perform F-statistic based
continuous gravitational wave (CW) searches.

Getting started:
* This README provides information on
installation,
[contributing](#contributors) to 
and [citing](#citing-this-work) PyFstat.
* Additional usage documentation will be added to the
[project wiki](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/wiki) (work in progress).
* We also have a number of
[examples](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/tree/master/examples),
demonstrating different use cases.

## Installation

PyFstat releases can be installed in a variety of ways, including
[Docker/Singularity images](#docker-container),
[`pip install` from PyPi](#pip-install-from-PyPi),
and [from source releases on Zenodo](#install-pyfstat-from-source-zenodo-or-git-clone).
Latest development versions can
[also be installed with pip](#pip-install-from-github)
or [from a local git clone](#install-pyfstat-from-source-zenodo-or-git-clone).

If you don't have a recent `python` installation (`3.6+`) on your system or
prefer `conda` environments over system-wide installation / venvs, please
start with the [conda installation](#conda-installation) section.

In either case, be sure to also check out the notes on
[dependencies](#dependencies),
[ephemerides files](#ephemerides-installation)
and [citing this work](#citing-this-work).

### Docker container
Ready-to-use PyFstat containers are available at the [Packages](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/packages)
page. A git-hub account together with a personal access token is required. [Go to the wiki page](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/wiki/Containers) to learn how to pull them from the git-hub
registry using Docker or Singularity.

### pip install from PyPi

PyPi releases are available from https://pypi.org/project/PyFstat/.

Note that the PyFstat installation will fail at the
[LALSuite](https://pypi.org/project/lalsuite/) dependency stage
if your `pip` is too old (e.g. 18.1); to be on the safe side, before starting do
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then, a simple
```
pip install pyfstat
```
should give you the latest release version with all dependencies.

If you are not installing into a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
or [conda environment](#conda-installation),
on many systems you may need to use the `--user` flag.

### conda installation

`PyFstat` requires `python3.6+`.
While many systems come with a system-wide python installation,
it may not be sufficiently recent for this package;
anyway, it can often be easier to manage a user-specific python installation
(this way one does not require root access to install or remove modules).
One method to do this is to use the `conda` system, either through
the stripped down [`Miniconda`](https://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
installation, or the full-featured
[`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads)
(these are essentially the
same, but the `Anaconda` version installs a variety of useful packages such as
`numpy` and `scipy` by default).
The fastest/easiest method is to follow your OS instructions
[here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
which will install `Miniconda`.

After you have installed a version of `conda` and
[set up an environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), 
`pip` can also be used to install modules into this environment.
(There is no direct `conda` release of `PyFstat` at the moment.)
This can be installed with
```
conda install pip
```
and then you can continue with the `pip` instructions,
either [a release version from PyPi](#pip-install-from-PyPi)
as described above
or [the latest development version directly from github](#pip-install-from-github)
as described below.

A simple way to get started with an otherwise clean environment
is to use a minimal .yml recipe file
[as explained here](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/wiki/conda-environments).

Alternatively, you may consider starting from an
[`igwn` environment](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/conda/),
which contains most packages relevant to gravitational waves,
instead of doing it from scratch,
and just adding `PyFstat` to it through pip as described above.
But be advised that the downloads for the `igwn` environments are huge.

### pip install from github

Development versions of PyFstat can also be easily installed by
pointing pip directly to this git repository,
which will give you the latest version of the master branch:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat
```
or, if you have an ssh key installed in github:
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat
```


### Dependencies

PyFstat uses the following external python modules,
which should all be pulled in automatically if you use `pip`:

* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [ptemcee](https://github.com/willvousden/ptemcee)
* [corner](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/corner/)
* [dill](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill)
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm)
* [bashplotlib](https://github.com/glamp/bashplotlib)
* [peakutils](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PeakUtils)
* [pathos](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathos)
* [lalsuite](https://pypi.org/project/lalsuite/)
* [versioneer](https://pypi.org/project/versioneer/)

In case the automatic install doesn't properly pull in all dependencies,
to install all of these modules manually, you can also run
```
pip install -r /PATH/TO/THIS/DIRECTORY/requirements.txt
```
For a general introduction to installing modules, see
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).

*Optional dependencies*:
* [pycuda](https://pypi.org/project/pycuda/),
  required for the `tCWFstatMapVersion=pycuda`
  option of the `TransientGridSearch` class.
  (Note: `pip install pycuda` requires a working `nvcc` compiler in your path.)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for running the test suite locally
  (`python -m pytest tests.py`)
* Developers are also highly encouraged to use
  the [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter
  and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io) style checker
  locally,
  as these checks are required to pass by the online integration pipeline.
* Some optional plotting methods depend on two additional packages,
  and some of the [examples](./examples) require these to run:
 [gridcorner](https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/GregAshton/gridcorner) 
  and [chainconsumer](https://github.com/Samreay/ChainConsumer);
for `pip` users this is most conveniently installed by
```
pip install git+https://gitlab.aei.uni-hannover.de/GregAshton/gridcorner
pip install chainconsumer
```
* If you prefer to make your own LALSuite installation
[from source](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/),
make sure it is **swig-enabled** and contains at least the `lalpulsar` and `lalapps` packages.
A minimal configuration line to use would be e.g.:
```
./configure --prefix=${HOME}/lalsuite-install --disable-all-lal --enable-lalpulsar --enable-lalapps --enable-swig
```


### install PyFstat from source (Zenodo or git clone)

You can download a source release tarball from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3967045)
and extract to an arbitrary temporary directory.
Alternatively, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat.git
```

The module and associated scripts can be installed system wide
(or to the currently active venv),
assuming you are in the (extracted or cloned) source directory, via
```
python setup.py install
```
As a developer, alternatively
```
python setup.py develop
```
or
```
pip install -e /path/to/PyFstat
```
can be useful so you can directly see any changes you make in action.
Alternatively (not recommended!), add the source directory directly to your python path.

To check that the installation
was successful, run
```
python -c 'import pyfstat'
```
if no error message is output, then you have installed `pyfstat`. Note that
the module will be installed to whichever python executable you call it from.

### Ephemerides installation

PyFstat requires paths to earth and sun ephemerides files
in order to use the `lalpulsar.ComputeFstat` module and various `lalapps` tools.

If you have done `pip install lalsuite`
(or it got pulled in automatically as a dependency),
you need to manually download at least these two files:
*  [earth00-40-DE405.dat.gz](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/raw/master/lalpulsar/lib/earth00-40-DE405.dat.gz)
*  [sun00-40-DE405.dat.gz](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/raw/master/lalpulsar/lib/sun00-40-DE405.dat.gz)

(Other ephemerides versions exist, but these two files should be sufficient for most applications.)
You then need to tell PyFstat where to find these files,
by either setting an environment variable `$LALPULSAR_DATADIR`
or by creating a `~/.pyfstat.conf` file as described further below.
If you are working with a virtual environment,
you should be able to get a full working ephemerides installation with these commands:
```
mkdir $VIRTUAL_ENV/share/lalpulsar
wget https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/raw/master/lalpulsar/lib/earth00-40-DE405.dat.gz -P $VIRTUAL_ENV/share/lalpulsar
wget https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite/raw/master/lalpulsar/lib/sun00-40-DE405.dat.gz -P $VIRTUAL_ENV/share/lalpulsar
echo 'export LALPULSAR_DATADIR=$VIRTUAL_ENV/share/lalpulsar' >> ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/bin/activate
deactivate
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
```

If instead you have built and installed lalsuite from source,
and set your path up properly through something like
`source $MYLALPATH/etc/lalsuite-user-env.sh`,
then the ephemerides path should be automatically picked up from
the `$LALPULSAR_DATADIR` environment variable.
Similarly, if you have installed lalsuite from conda-forge,
it should come with ephemerides included and properly set up.

Alternatively, you can place a file
`~/.pyfstat.conf` into your home directory which looks like

```
earth_ephem = '/home/<USER>/lalsuite-install/share/lalpulsar/earth00-19-DE405.dat.gz'
sun_ephem = '/home/<USER>/lalsuite-install/share/lalpulsar/sun00-19-DE405.dat.gz'
```
Paths set in this way will take precedence over the environment variable.

Finally, you can manually specify ephemerides files when initialising
each PyFstat search (as one of the arguments).

This project is open to development, please feel free to contact us
for advice or just jump in and submit an
[issue](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/issues/new/choose) or
[pull request](https://github.com/PyFstat/PyFstat/compare).

Here's what you need to know:
* The github automated tests currently run on `python` [3.6,3.7,3.8] and new PRs need to pass all these.
* The automated test also runs
  the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io) style checker
  and the [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter.
  If at all possible, please run these two tools locally before pushing changes / submitting PRs:
  `flake8 --count --statistics .` to find common coding errors and then fix them manually,
  and then
  `black --check --diff .` to show the required style changes, or `black .` to automatically apply them.
